This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router v6 where a more specific route is masked by a more general route due to substring matching. The `App.js` file shows the problematic code, while `AppSolution.js` provides the correct implementation. The problem is that the route `/aboutus` will never be matched because the router matches `/about` first. The solution is to reorder the routes or use more specific matching strategies.
